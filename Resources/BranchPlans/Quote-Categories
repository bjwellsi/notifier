This won't exactly be organized or whatever, just a collection of my thoughts for when this merges.
Basically the goal of this branch is to allow quote categories to exist on the backend. They don't actually need to be implemented yet, just basically this should result in:
* all quotes having a category in the DB
* the controller setting the quote category when the quotes are added 
* the quotes having a default category of username-quotes
* removal of a username resulting in all owned private quotes disappearing 

Basically the only things that need to change are the table controller, the values sent to it, and the database schema
